- **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000/callback`

### Gemini API ✅
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyB2ZlO3BHpQopIKcmqMwhro1j5wGYYriXQ`
- **Model**: `gemini-pro`

## 🧪 Testing the Complete Integration

### Step 1: Test Individual APIs

#### Test Spotify API
1. **Open** `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Click** "Test Spotify API" button
3. **Expected Result**: `✅ Spotify API working! Found X tracks for "happy"`

#### Test Gemini AI
1. **Click** "Test Gemini AI" button
2. **Expected Result**: `✅ Gemini API working! Extracted terms: happy, workout, energy`

### Step 2: Test Full Integration

#### Generate a Real Playlist
1. **Enter** a mood description like:
   - "I'm feeling happy and want to workout"
   - "Need relaxing music for studying"
   - "Feeling melancholic on a rainy day"

2. **Click** "Generate Playlist"
3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Real Spotify tracks (not demo tracks)
   - ✅ No "Demo Mode" badge
   - ✅ Actual album artwork
   - ✅ Console shows: "Search terms from Gemini: [array]"

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Indicators
- **Both test buttons show green success messages**
- **Real Spotify tracks appear** with actual metadata

- **No demo mode** - everything uses real APIs
- **Fast response times** (2-5 seconds for playlist generation)

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **User Input**: "I'm feeling energetic and want to workout"
2. **Gemini AI**: Extracts search terms like `["workout", "gym", "energy", "motivation"]`
3. **Spotify API**: Searches for tracks using those terms
4. **Result**: Curated playlist with real workout music

Gemini should extract: ["sad", "melancholy", "emotional", "rain"]
Spotify should find: Emotional, slower-tempo tracks
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Gemini API Test Fails
**Symptoms**: "Test Gemini AI" shows error
**Solutions**:
1. Verify API key in `.env.local` matches exactly
2. Check for internet connection
3. Look for quota limits (free tier has usage limits)

### Issue 2: Spotify API Test Fails
**Symptoms**: "Test Spotify API" shows error
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Spotify credentials are correct
2. Ensure app is in development mode
3. Check redirect URI matches exactly

### Issue 3: Still Seeing Demo Mode
**Symptoms**: Demo tracks appear despite API configuration
**Solutions**:
1. Restart development server
2. Check both API tests pass first
3. Look for console errors

### Issue 4: Slow Response Times
**Symptoms**: Playlist generation takes >10 seconds
**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Monitor API response times in console
3. Try simpler mood descriptions

## 🔧 Advanced Testing

### Monitor Network Requests
1. **Open** browser dev tools (F12)
2. **Go to** Network tab
3. **Generate** a playlist
4. **Check** `/api/generate-playlist` request
5. **Verify** response contains real track data

### Console Logging
1. **Open** Console tab in dev tools
2. **Look for** these key messages:
   - `Search terms from Gemini: [array]`
   - `✓ Found X tracks for search`
   - API authentication success messages

### API Endpoint Testing
- **Spotify Test**: `http://localhost:3000/api/test-spotify`
